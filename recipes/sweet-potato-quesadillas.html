    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        I recently cut meat out of my diet completely. In my quest for 
        new and interesting meals, I came up with these delicious 
        quesadillas!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large sweet potato, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup frozen corn</li>
        <li>1 (19 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>8 (8 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted 
            water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 
            until very tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and transfer to a 
            bowl. Mash sweet potatoes and mix in cilantro, chili powder, 
            and salt.
        </li>
        <li> 
            Place corn in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high 
            until warmed, 1 to 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread 1/4 cup sweet potato mixture onto 1 tortilla; cover with
            1/4 cup black beans and 1 tablespoon corn. Sprinkle 1/4 cup 
            Cheddar cheese atop corn; cover with a tortilla. Repeat with 
            remaining tortillas and fillings.
        </li>
        <li> 
            Spray a frying pan with cooking spray and place over medium 
            heat; cook 1 quesadilla in the hot pan until cheese is melted 
            and beans are heated through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat 
            with remaining quesadillas; slice into quarters.
        </li>
    </ol>
